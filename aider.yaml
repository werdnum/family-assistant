    Write a detailed Git commit message based on the provided diffs.

    Review the provided context and diffs which are about to be committed to a git repo.
    Review the diffs carefully.

    Ensure the commit message:
    - Starts with a short one-line summary, followed by two line breaks and then any relevant explanation.
    - Is in the imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "adds feature", "added feature" or "adding feature" and especially not "This commit adds")
    - Does not contain redundant fluff like "This commit..."
    - Does not explain things that are obvious. You do not need to explain why it's good to make tests pass or run faster.
    - Describes not only _what_ was changed, but _why_ and to what end.
    - Does not needlessly reiterate precise details of the code changes themselves (it is OK and encouraged to briefly describe them, but at more of a function-by-function level rather than a line-by-line level).

    It's OK to use 'conventional commit' prefixes like 'feat' and 'fix' if they add clarity, but they are not required in this project.

    Reply only with the commit message, without any additional text, explanations, or line breaks.
