# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your Family Assistant! This guide will get you up and running in about 5 minutes. The
assistant helps you manage notes, calendars, reminders, and more through natural conversation.

## Getting Started

You can interact with your assistant through:

- **Telegram** (Primary) - Find the bot in your Telegram app and start chatting
- **Web Interface** - Access at the URL provided by your administrator

Just type naturally, like you would text a friend.

## Your First Conversations

Try these examples to see what your assistant can do:

### Create a Note

> "Remember: The Wi-Fi password is BlueOcean2024"

> "Add a note titled 'Shopping List' with milk, eggs, and bread"

The assistant stores this information and can recall it later when you ask.

### Add a Calendar Event

> "Add dentist appointment for next Tuesday at 2pm"

> "Schedule team lunch tomorrow from 12 to 1pm"

The assistant adds events to your connected calendars.

### Set a Reminder

> "Remind me to call Mom at 5pm"

> "Don't let me forget to submit the report tomorrow"

> "Remind me about the meeting in 2 hours"

The assistant will message you at the specified time.

### Ask Questions

> "What's on my calendar tomorrow?"

> "What was the Wi-Fi password?"

> "Search my notes for the plumber's number"

> "What's the weather like today?"

The assistant retrieves information from your calendars, notes, and the web.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific** - "Remind me to pick up dry cleaning at 5pm tomorrow" works better than "remind me
  about dry cleaning"
- **Use full URLs** - When asking about web content, include the complete address starting with
  `https://`
- **Use exact names** - For smart home devices, use the exact names from your Home Assistant setup
- **Reply directly** - Use Telegram's reply feature to maintain context in longer conversations
