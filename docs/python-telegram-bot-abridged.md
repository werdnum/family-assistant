---

## Introduction [¶](about:blank#introduction)

This library provides a pure Python, asynchronous interface for the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) .
It’s compatible with Python versions **3.9+**.

In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features several convenience methods and shortcuts as well as a number of high-level classes to
make the development of bots easy and straightforward. These classes are contained in the `telegram.ext` submodule.

After [installing](about:blank#installing) the library, be sure to check out the section on [working with PTB](about:blank#working-with-ptb).

---

### Telegram API support [¶](about:blank#telegram-api-support)

All types and methods of the Telegram Bot API **8.3**are natively supported by this library.
In addition, Bot API functionality not yet natively included can still be used as described [in our wiki](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Bot-API-Forward-Compatibility).

---

---

### Notable Features [¶](about:blank#notable-features)

- [Fully asynchronous](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Concurrency)
- Convenient shortcut methods, e.g.[Message.reply_text](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/stable/telegram.message.html#telegram.Message.reply_text)
- [Fully annotated with static type hints](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Type-Checking)
- [Customizable and extendable interface](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Architecture)
- Seamless integration with[webhooks](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Webhooks)   and[polling](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/stable/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram.ext.Application.run_polling)
- [Comprehensive documentation and examples](about:blank#working-with-ptb)

---

---

---

## Installing [¶](about:blank#installing)

You can install or upgrade `python-telegram-bot` via

$ pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade To install a pre-release, use the `--pre` [flag](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-pre) in addition.

You can also install `python-telegram-bot` from source, though this is usually not necessary.

$ git clone https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot
$ cd python-telegram-bot
$ pip install build
$ python -m build---

### Verifying Releases [¶](about:blank#verifying-releases)

To enable you to verify that a release file that you downloaded was indeed provided by the `python-telegram-bot` team, we have taken the following measures.

Starting with v21.4, all releases are signed via [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) .
The corresponding signature files are uploaded to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/releases) .
To verify the signature, please install the [sigstore Python client](https://pypi.org/project/sigstore/) and follow the instructions for [verifying signatures from GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python?tab=readme-ov-file) . As input for the `--repository` parameter, please use the value `python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot`.

Earlier releases are signed with a GPG key.
The signatures are uploaded to both the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/releases) and the [PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/) and end with a suffix `.asc` .
Please find the public keys [here](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/public_keys) .
The keys are named in the format `<first_version>-<last_version>.gpg`.

In addition, the GitHub release page also contains the sha1 hashes of the release files in the files with the suffix `.sha1`.

---

---

### Dependencies & Their Versions [¶](about:blank#dependencies-their-versions)

`python-telegram-bot` tries to use as few 3rd party dependencies as possible.
However, for some features using a 3rd party library is more sane than implementing the functionality again.
As these features are *optional*, the corresponding 3rd party dependencies are not installed by default.
Instead, they are listed as optional dependencies.
This allows to avoid unnecessary dependency conflicts for users who don’t need the optional features.

The only required dependency is [httpx ~= 0.27](https://www.python-httpx.org/) for `telegram.request.HTTPXRequest` , the default networking backend.

`python-telegram-bot` is most useful when used along with additional libraries.
To minimize dependency conflicts, we try to be liberal in terms of version requirements on the (optional) dependencies.
On the other hand, we have to ensure stability of `python-telegram-bot` , which is why we do apply version bounds.
If you encounter dependency conflicts due to these bounds, feel free to reach out.

---

#### Optional Dependencies [¶](about:blank#optional-dependencies)

PTB can be installed with optional dependencies:

- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[passport]"`   installs the[cryptography>=39.0.1](https://cryptography.io/en/stable)   library. Use this, if you want to use Telegram Passport related functionality.
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[socks]"`   installs[httpx[socks]](https://www.python-httpx.org/#dependencies)   . Use this, if you want to work behind a Socks5 server.
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[http2]"`   installs[httpx[http2]](https://www.python-httpx.org/#dependencies)   . Use this, if you want to use HTTP/2.
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[rate-limiter]"`   installs[aiolimiter~=1.1,<1.3](https://aiolimiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)   . Use this, if you want to use `telegram.ext.AIORateLimiter`  .
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[webhooks]"`   installs the[tornado~=6.4](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)   library. Use this, if you want to use `telegram.ext.Updater.start_webhook`   / `telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook`  .
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[callback-data]"`   installs the[cachetools>=5.3.3,<5.6.0](https://cachetools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)   library. Use this, if you want to use[arbitrary callback_data](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Arbitrary-callback_data)  .
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue]"`   installs the[APScheduler>=3.10.4,<3.12.0](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/)   library. Use this, if you want to use the `telegram.ext.JobQueue`  .

To install multiple optional dependencies, separate them by commas, e.g. `pip install "python-telegram-bot[socks,webhooks]"`.

Additionally, two shortcuts are provided:

- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[all]"`   installs all optional dependencies.
- `pip install "python-telegram-bot[ext]"`   installs all optional dependencies that are related to `telegram.ext`   , i.e. `[rate-limiter, webhooks, callback-data, job-queue]`  .

## Working with PTB [¶](about:blank#working-with-ptb)

Once you have installed the library, you can begin working with it - so let’s get started!

---

### Quick Start [¶](about:blank#quick-start)

Our Wiki contains an [Introduction to the API](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Introduction-to-the-API) explaining how the pure Bot API can be accessed via `python-telegram-bot` .
Moreover, the [Tutorial: Your first Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions---Your-first-Bot) gives an introduction on how chatbots can be easily programmed with the help of the `telegram.ext` module.

---

---

### Resources [¶](about:blank#resources)

- The[package documentation](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/)   is the technical reference for `python-telegram-bot`   .
It contains descriptions of all available classes, modules, methods and arguments as well as the[changelog](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/changelog.html)  .

- The[wiki](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/)   is home to number of more elaborate introductions of the different features of `python-telegram-bot`   and other useful resources that go beyond the technical documentation.
- Our[examples section](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/examples.html)   contains several examples that showcase the different features of both the Bot API and `python-telegram-bot`   .
Even if it is not your approach for learning, please take a look at `echobot.py`   . It is the de facto base for most of the bots out there.
The code for these examples is released to the public domain, so you can start by grabbing the code and building on top of it.

- The[official Telegram Bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)   is of course always worth a read.

---

---

### Getting help [¶](about:blank#getting-help)

If the resources mentioned above don’t answer your questions or simply overwhelm you, there are several ways of getting help.

1. We have a vibrant community of developers helping each other in our[Telegram group](https://telegram.me/pythontelegrambotgroup)   . Join us! Asking a question here is often the quickest way to get a pointer in the right direction.
2. Ask questions by opening[a discussion](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/discussions/new)  .
3. You can even ask for help on Stack Overflow using the[python-telegram-bot tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-telegram-bot)  .

---

---

### Concurrency [¶](about:blank#concurrency)

Since v20.0, `python-telegram-bot` is built on top of Pythons `asyncio` module.
Because `asyncio` is in general single-threaded, `python-telegram-bot` does currently not aim to be thread-safe.
Noteworthy parts of `python-telegram-bots` API that are likely to cause issues (e.g. race conditions) when used in a multi-threaded setting include:

- `telegram.ext.Application/Updater.update_queue`
- `telegram.ext.ConversationHandler.check/handle_update`
- `telegram.ext.CallbackDataCache`
- `telegram.ext.BasePersistence`
- all classes in the `telegram.ext.filters`   module that allow to add/remove allowed users/chats at runtime

---

---

---

## Contributing [¶](about:blank#contributing)

Contributions of all sizes are welcome.
Please review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst) to get started.
You can also help by [reporting bugs or feature requests](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/new/choose).

---

---

## Donating [¶](about:blank#donating)

Occasionally we are asked if we accept donations to support the development.
While we appreciate the thought, maintaining PTB is our hobby, and we have almost no running costs for it. We therefore have nothing set up to accept donations.
If you still want to donate, we kindly ask you to donate to another open source project/initiative of your choice instead.

---

---

#  `customwebhookbot.py` [¶](about:blank#customwebhookbot-py)

This example is available for different web frameworks.
You can select your preferred framework by opening one of the tabs above the code example.

Hint

The following examples show how different Python web frameworks can be used alongside PTB.
This can be useful for two use cases:

1. For extending the functionality of your existing bot to handling updates of external services
2. For extending the functionality of your exisiting web application to also include chat bot functionality

How the PTB and web framework components of the examples below are viewed surely depends on which use case one has in mind.
We are fully aware that a combination of PTB with web frameworks will always mean finding a tradeoff between usability and best practices for both PTB and the web framework and these examples are certainly far from optimal solutions.
Please understand them as starting points and use your expertise of the web framework of your choosing to build up on them.
You are of course also very welcome to help improve these examples!

Note that any other `asyncio` based web server framework can be used for a custom webhook setup

# Bot [¶](about:blank#bot)

*class*telegram. Bot ( *token*, *base_url = 'https://api.telegram.org/bot'*, *base_file_url = 'https://api.telegram.org/file/bot'*, *request = None*, *get_updates_request = None*, *private_key = None*, *private_key_password = None*, *local_mode = False*) [[source]](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/v22.0/telegram/_bot.py#L166-L10367) [¶](about:blank#telegram.Bot) Bases:<a href="telegram.telegramobject.html#telegram.TelegramObject"> `telegram.TelegramObject`</a>,<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager"> `contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager`</a>

This object represents a Telegram Bot.

Instances of this class can be used as asyncio context managers, where

async with bot: # code is roughly equivalent to

try: await bot. initialize () # code finally: await bot. shutdown () See also

<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.__aenter__"> `__aenter__()`</a> and<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.__aexit__"> `__aexit__()`</a>.

Note

- Most bot methods have the argument `api_kwargs`   which allows passing arbitrary keywords
to the Telegram API. This can be used to access new features of the API before they are
incorporated into PTB. The limitations to this argument are the same as the ones
described in<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.do_api_request"> `do_api_request()`</a>  .

- Bots should not be serialized since if you for e.g. change the bots token, then your
serialized instance will not reflect that change. Trying to pickle a bot instance will
raise<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError"> `pickle.PicklingError`</a>   . Trying to deepcopy a bot instance will raise<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError"> `TypeError`</a>  .

Added in version 13.2: Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
considered equal, if their<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.bot"> `bot`</a> is equal.

Changed in version 20.0:

- Removed the deprecated methods `kick_chat_member`  , `kickChatMember`  , `get_chat_members_count`   and `getChatMembersCount`  .
- Removed the deprecated property `commands`  .
- Removed the deprecated `defaults`   parameter. If you want to use<a href="telegram.ext.defaults.html#telegram.ext.Defaults"> `telegram.ext.Defaults`</a>   , please use the subclass<a href="telegram.ext.extbot.html#telegram.ext.ExtBot"> `telegram.ext.ExtBot`</a>   instead.
- Attempting to pickle a bot instance will now raise<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError"> `pickle.PicklingError`</a>  .
- Attempting to deepcopy a bot instance will now raise<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError"> `TypeError`</a>  .
- The following are now keyword-only arguments in Bot methods: `location`  , `filename`  , `venue`  , `contact`  , `{read, write, connect, pool}_timeout`  , `api_kwargs`   . Use a named argument for those,
and notice that some positional arguments changed position as a result.

- For uploading files, file paths are now always accepted. If<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.local_mode"> `local_mode`</a>   is<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False"> `False`</a>   , the file contents will be read in binary mode and uploaded. Otherwise,
the file path will be passed in the[file URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme)  .

Changed in version 20.5: Removed deprecated methods `set_sticker_set_thumb` and `setStickerSetThumb` .
Use<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.set_sticker_set_thumbnail"> `set_sticker_set_thumbnail()`</a> and<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.setStickerSetThumbnail"> `setStickerSetThumbnail()`</a> instead.

Parameters:

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.token">**token**</a>   (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   ) – Bot’s unique authentication token.
- <a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.base_url">**base_url**</a>   (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   | Callable[[<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   ],<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   ], optional) –

  Telegram Bot API
service URL. If the string contains `{token}`   , it will be replaced with the bot’s
token. If a callable is passed, it will be called with the bot’s token as the only
argument and must return the base URL. Otherwise, the token will be appended to the
string. Defaults to `"https://api.telegram.org/bot"`  .

  Tip

  Customizing the base URL can be used to run a bot against[Local Bot API Server](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Local-Bot-API-Server)   or using Telegrams[test environment](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#dedicated-test-environment)  .

  Example: `"https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/test"`

  Changed in version 21.11:   Supports callable input and string formatting.

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.base_file_url">**base_file_url**</a>   (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   , optional) –

If the string contains `{token}`   , it will be replaced with the bot’s
token. If a callable is passed, it will be called with the bot’s token as the only
argument and must return the base URL. Otherwise, the token will be appended to the
string. Defaults to `"https://api.telegram.org/bot"`  .

  Tip

Will be used for all bot methods*except*for<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.get_updates"> `get_updates()`</a>   . If not passed, an instance of<a href="telegram.request.httpxrequest.html#telegram.request.HTTPXRequest"> `telegram.request.HTTPXRequest`</a>   will be used.
- <a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.get_updates_request">**get_updates_request**</a>   (<a href="telegram.request.baserequest.html#telegram.request.BaseRequest"> `telegram.request.BaseRequest`</a>   , optional) – Pre initialized<a href="telegram.request.baserequest.html#telegram.request.BaseRequest"> `telegram.request.BaseRequest`</a>   instances. Will be used exclusively for<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.get_updates"> `get_updates()`</a>   . If not passed, an instance of<a href="telegram.request.httpxrequest.html#telegram.request.HTTPXRequest"> `telegram.request.HTTPXRequest`</a>   will be used.

the URI of a[Local Bot API Server](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#using-a-local-bot-api-server)   that runs with the `--local`   flag. Currently, the only effect of
this is that files are uploaded using their local path in the[file URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme)   .
Defaults to<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False"> `False`</a>  .

The link can be revoked using the method<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.revoke_chat_invite_link"> `revoke_chat_invite_link()`</a>.

Note

When joining *public*groups via an invite link, Telegram clients may display the
usual “Join” button, effectively ignoring the invite link. In particular, the parameter<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.create_chat_invite_link.params.creates_join_request"> `creates_join_request`</a> has no effect in this case.
However, this behavior is undocument and may be subject to change.
See [this GitHub thread](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api/issues/429) for some discussion.

This method is here to make it easier to use new API methods that are not yet supported
by this library.

Hint

Since PTB does not know which arguments are passed to this method, some caution is
necessary in terms of PTBs utility functionalities. In particular

- passing objects of any class defined in the<a href="telegram.html#module-telegram"> `telegram`</a>   module is supported
- when uploading files, a<a href="telegram.inputfile.html#telegram.InputFile"> `telegram.InputFile`</a>   must be passed as the value for
the corresponding argument. Passing a file path or file-like object will not work.
File paths will work only in combination with<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.local_mode"> `local_mode`</a>  .

- when uploading files, PTB can still correctly determine that
a special write timeout value should be used instead of the default<a href="telegram.request.httpxrequest.html#telegram.request.HTTPXRequest.params.write_timeout"> `telegram.request.HTTPXRequest.write_timeout`</a>  .

- insertion of default values specified via<a href="telegram.ext.defaults.html#telegram.ext.Defaults"> `telegram.ext.Defaults`</a>   will not
work (only relevant for<a href="telegram.ext.extbot.html#telegram.ext.ExtBot"> `telegram.ext.ExtBot`</a>   ).

- The only exception is<a href="telegram.ext.defaults.html#telegram.ext.Defaults.tzinfo"> `telegram.ext.Defaults.tzinfo`</a>   , which will be correctly
applied to<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime"> `datetime.datetime`</a>   objects.

link is revoked. The bot must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must
have the appropriate admin rights.

Note

Each administrator in a chat generates their own invite links. Bots can’t use invite
links generated by other administrators. If you want your bot to work with invite
links, it will need to generate its own link using<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.export_chat_invite_link"> `export_chat_invite_link()`</a> or
by calling the<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.get_chat"> `get_chat()`</a> method. If your bot needs to generate a new primary
invite link replacing its previous one, use<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.export_chat_invite_link"> `export_chat_invite_link()`</a> again.

Service messages can’t be forwarded.

Note

Since the release of Bot API 5.5 it can be impossible to forward messages from
some chats. Use the attributes<a href="telegram.message.html#telegram.Message.has_protected_content"> `telegram.Message.has_protected_content`</a> and<a href="telegram.chatfullinfo.html#telegram.ChatFullInfo.has_protected_content"> `telegram.ChatFullInfo.has_protected_content`</a> to check this.

As a workaround, it is still possible to use<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.copy_message"> `copy_message()`</a> . However, this
behaviour is undocumented and might be changed by Telegram.

Pass a `file_id`   as String to send a file that exists on the Telegram servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL as a String for Telegram to get a file from the Internet, or upload a new one. To upload a file, you can either pass a[file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object)   (e.g. `open("filename", "rb")`   ), the file contents as bytes or the path of the file (as string or<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path"> `pathlib.Path`</a>   object).

technical requirements.

  Pass a `file_id`   as String to send a file that exists on the Telegram servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL as a String for Telegram to get a file from the Internet, or upload a new one. To upload a file, you can either pass a[file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object)   (e.g. `open("filename", "rb")`   ), the file contents as bytes or the path of the file (as string or<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path"> `pathlib.Path`</a>   object). In the latter case, the file contents will either be read as bytes or the file path will be passed to Telegram, depending on the<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.local_mode"> `local_mode`</a>   setting.

  Animated and video sticker set thumbnails can’t be uploaded via HTTP URL. If

Whenever there is an update for the bot, Telegram will send an HTTPS POST request to the
specified url, containing An Update. In case of an unsuccessful request
(a request with response HTTP status code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes>`_different
from ``2XY` ),
Telegram will repeat the request and give up after a reasonable amount of attempts.

If you’d like to make sure that the Webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in
the parameter<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.set_webhook.params.secret_token"> `secret_token`</a> . If specified, the request will contain a header `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` with the secret token as content.

Note

1. You will not be able to receive updates using<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.get_updates"> `get_updates()`</a>   for long as an
outgoing webhook is set up.

2. To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your public key certificate
using<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.set_webhook.params.certificate"> `certificate`</a>   parameter. Please upload as<a href="telegram.inputfile.html#telegram.InputFile"> `InputFile`</a>   , sending a String will not work.

3. Ports currently supported for Webhooks:<a href="telegram.constants.html#telegram.constants.SUPPORTED_WEBHOOK_PORTS"> `telegram.constants.SUPPORTED_WEBHOOK_PORTS`</a>  .

If you’re having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this [guide to
Webhooks](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks).

certificate in use can be checked. See our[self-signed guide](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Webhooks#creating-a-self-signed-certificate-using-openssl)   for details.
To upload a file, you can either pass a[file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object)   (e.g. `open("filename", "rb")`   ) or the file contents as bytes. If the bot is running in<a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.params.local_mode"> `local_mode`</a>   , passing the path of the file (as string or<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path"> `pathlib.Path`</a>   object) is supported as well.

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.set_webhook.params.ip_address">**ip_address**</a>   (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   , optional) – The fixed IP address which will be used to send

Defaults to `40`   . Use lower values to limit the load on your bot’s server,
and higher values to increase your bot’s throughput.

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.Bot.set_webhook.params.allowed_updates">**allowed_updates**</a>   (Sequence[<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str"> `str`</a>   ], optional) –

  A sequence of the types of
updates you want your bot to receive. For example, specify [“message”,
“edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive updates of these types.
See<a href="telegram.update.html#telegram.Update"> `telegram.Update`</a>   for a complete list of available update types.
Specify an empty sequence to receive all updates except<a href="telegram.update.html#telegram.Update.chat_member"> `telegram.Update.chat_member`</a>  ,<a href="telegram.update.html#telegram.Update.message_reaction"> `telegram.Update.message_reaction`</a>   and<a href="telegram.update.html#telegram.Update.message_reaction_count"> `telegram.Update.message_reaction_count`</a>   (default). If not
specified, the previous setting will be used. Please note that this
parameter doesn’t affect
updates created before the call to the set_webhook, so unwanted update
may be received for a short period of time.

  Changed in version 20.0:   Accepts any<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence"> `collections.abc.Sequence`</a>   as input instead of just a list.

The user will *not*return to the group or channel automatically, but will be able to join
via link, etc. The bot must be an administrator for this to work. By default, this method
guarantees that after the call the user is not a member of the chat, but will be able to
join it. So if the user is a member of the chat they will also be *removed*from the chat.

*class*telegram.ext. Application ( ***, *bot*, *update_queue*, *updater*, *job_queue*, *update_processor*, *persistence*, *context_types*, *post_init*, *post_shutdown*, *post_stop*) [[source]](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/v22.0/telegram/ext/_application.py#L117-L1891) [¶](about:blank#telegram.ext.Application) Bases:<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic"> `typing.Generic`</a>,<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager"> `contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager`</a>

This class dispatches all kinds of updates to its registered handlers, and is the entry
point to a PTB application.

Tip

This class may not be initialized directly. Use<a href="telegram.ext.applicationbuilder.html#telegram.ext.ApplicationBuilder"> `telegram.ext.ApplicationBuilder`</a> or<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.builder"> `builder()`</a> (for convenience).

Instances of this class can be used as asyncio context managers, where

async with application: # code is roughly equivalent to

try: await application. initialize () # code finally: await application. shutdown () See also

<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.__aenter__"> `__aenter__()`</a> and<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.__aexit__"> `__aexit__()`</a>.

This class is a<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic"> `Generic`</a> class and accepts six type variables:

1. The type of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.bot"> `bot`</a>   . Must be<a href="telegram.bot.html#telegram.Bot"> `telegram.Bot`</a>   or a subclass of that class.
2. The type of the argument `context`   of callback functions for (error) handlers and jobs.
Must be<a href="telegram.ext.callbackcontext.html#telegram.ext.CallbackContext"> `telegram.ext.CallbackContext`</a>   or a subclass of that class. This must be
consistent with the following types.

3. The type of the values of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.user_data"> `user_data`</a>  .
4. The type of the values of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.chat_data"> `chat_data`</a>  .
5. The type of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.bot_data"> `bot_data`</a>  .
6. The type of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.job_queue"> `job_queue`</a>   . Must either be<a href="telegram.ext.jobqueue.html#telegram.ext.JobQueue"> `telegram.ext.JobQueue`</a>   or a subclass
of that or<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None"> `None`</a>  .

available as<a href="telegram.ext.callbackcontext.html#telegram.ext.CallbackContext.chat_data"> `telegram.ext.CallbackContext.chat_data`</a> in handler callbacks for
updates from that chat.

Changed in version 20.0:<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.chat_data"> `chat_data`</a> is now read-only. Note that the values of the mapping are still
mutable, i.e. editing `context.chat_data` within a handler callback is possible
(and encouraged), but editing the mapping `application.chat_data` itself is not.

Tip

- Manually modifying<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.chat_data"> `chat_data`</a>   is almost never needed and unadvisable.
- Entries are never deleted automatically from this mapping. If you want to delete
the data associated with a specific chat, e.g. if the bot got removed from that

should be awaited before processing the next error handler in<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.process_error"> `process_error()`</a>   . Defaults to<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True"> `True`</a>  .

add_handler ( *handler*, *group = 0*) [[source]](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/v22.0/telegram/ext/_application.py#L1318-L1382) [¶](about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.add_handler) Register a handler.

TL;DR: Order and priority counts. 0 or 1 handlers per group will be used. End handling of
update with<a href="telegram.ext.applicationhandlerstop.html#telegram.ext.ApplicationHandlerStop"> `telegram.ext.ApplicationHandlerStop`</a>.

A handler must be an instance of a subclass of<a href="telegram.ext.basehandler.html#telegram.ext.BaseHandler"> `telegram.ext.BaseHandler`</a> . All
handlers
are organized in groups with a numeric value. The default group is 0. All groups will be
evaluated for handling an update, but only 0 or 1 handler per group will be used. If<a href="telegram.ext.applicationhandlerstop.html#telegram.ext.ApplicationHandlerStop"> `telegram.ext.ApplicationHandlerStop`</a> is raised from one of the handlers, no further
handlers (regardless of the group) will be called.

The priority/order of handlers is determined as follows:

- Priority of the group (lower group number == higher priority)
- The first handler in a group which can handle an update (see<a href="telegram.ext.basehandler.html#telegram.ext.BaseHandler.check_update"> `telegram.ext.BaseHandler.check_update`</a>   ) will be used. Other handlers from the
group will not be used. The order in which handlers were added to the group defines the
priority.

Warning

Adding persistent<a href="telegram.ext.conversationhandler.html#telegram.ext.ConversationHandler"> `telegram.ext.ConversationHandler`</a> after the application has
been initialized is discouraged. This is because the persisted conversation states need
to be loaded into memory while the application is already processing updates, which
might lead to race conditions and undesired behavior. In particular, current
conversation states may be overridden by the loaded data.

Parameters:

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.add_handler.params.handler">**handler**</a>   (<a href="telegram.ext.basehandler.html#telegram.ext.BaseHandler"> `telegram.ext.BaseHandler`</a>   ) – A BaseHandler instance.

sequence(s) matters. See<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.add_handler"> `add_handler()`</a> for details.

Added in version 20.0.

Parameters:

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.add_handlers.params.handlers">**handlers**</a>   (Sequence[<a href="telegram.ext.basehandler.html#telegram.ext.BaseHandler"> `telegram.ext.BaseHandler`</a>   ] |                 dict[int, Sequence[<a href="telegram.ext.basehandler.html#telegram.ext.BaseHandler"> `telegram.ext.BaseHandler`</a>   ]]) –

  Specify a sequence of handlers*or*a dictionary where the keys are groups and
values are handlers.

  Changed in version 21.7:   Accepts any<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence"> `collections.abc.Sequence`</a>   as input instead of just a list
or tuple.

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.add_handlers.params.group">**group**</a>   (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int"> `int`</a>   , optional) – Specify which group the sequence of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.add_handlers.params.handlers"> `handlers`</a>   should be added to. Defaults to `0`  .

Example:

app. add_handlers ( handlers = { - 1: [MessageHandler ( ... )], 1: [CallbackQueryHandler ( ... ), CommandHandler ( ... )] } Raises: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError">**TypeError**</a> – If the combination of arguments is invalid.

Tip

Use this method sparingly. If you have to use this method, it likely means that you
access and modify `context.application.chat/user_data[some_id]` within a callback.
Note that for data which should be available globally in all handler callbacks
independent of the chat/user, it is recommended to use<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.bot_data"> `bot_data`</a> instead.

Tip

- When combining `python-telegram-bot`   with other<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio"> `asyncio`</a>   based frameworks, using this
method is likely not the best choice, as it blocks the event loop until it receives a stop
signal as described above.
Instead, you can manually call the methods listed below to start and shut down the application
and the<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.updater"> `updater`</a>   .
Keeping the event loop running and listening for a stop signal is then up to you.

- To gracefully stop the execution of this method from within a handler, job or error callback,
use<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.stop_running"> `stop_running()`</a>  .

Changed in version Removed: the deprecated parameters `read_timeout`, `write_timeout`, `connect_timeout` , and `pool_timeout` . Use the corresponding methods in<a href="telegram.ext.applicationbuilder.html#telegram.ext.ApplicationBuilder"> `telegram.ext.ApplicationBuilder`</a> instead.

will retry on failures on the Telegram server.

  - < 0 - retry indefinitely
  - 0 - no retries (default)
  - > 0 - retry up to X times

  Changed in version 21.11:   The default value will be changed to from `-1`   to `0`   . Indefinite retries

listening for updates from Telegram using<a href="telegram.ext.updater.html#telegram.ext.Updater.start_webhook"> `telegram.ext.Updater.start_webhook()`</a> and
a graceful shutdown of the app on exit.

The app will shut down when<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt"> `KeyboardInterrupt`</a> or<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit"> `SystemExit`</a> is raised. This also works from within handlers, error handlers and jobs. However, using<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.stop_running"> `stop_running()`</a> will give a somewhat cleaner shutdown behavior than manually raising those exceptions. On unix, the app will also shut down on receiving the signals specified by<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook.params.stop_signals"> `stop_signals`</a>.

If<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook.params.cert"> `cert`</a> and<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook.params.key"> `key`</a> are not provided, the webhook will be started directly on `http://listen:port/url_path` , so SSL can be handled by another
application. Else, the webhook will be started on `https://listen:port/url_path` . Also calls<a href="telegram.bot.html#telegram.Bot.set_webhook"> `telegram.Bot.set_webhook()`</a> as
required.

The order of execution by<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook"> `run_webhook()`</a> is roughly as follows:

- <a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.initialize"> `initialize()`</a>
- <a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.post_init"> `post_init()`</a>
- <a href="telegram.ext.updater.html#telegram.ext.Updater.start_webhook"> `telegram.ext.Updater.start_webhook()`</a>

stop_running ( ) [[source]](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/v22.0/telegram/ext/_application.py#L702-L738) [¶](about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.stop_running) This method can be used to stop the execution of<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_polling"> `run_polling()`</a> or<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook"> `run_webhook()`</a> from within a handler, job or error callback. This allows a graceful
shutdown of the application, i.e. the methods listed in<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_polling"> `run_polling`</a> and<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook"> `run_webhook`</a> will still be executed.

This method can also be called within<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.post_init"> `post_init()`</a> . This allows for a graceful,
early shutdown of the application if some condition is met (e.g., a database connection
could not be established).

Note

If the application is not running and this method is not called within<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.post_init"> `post_init()`</a> , this method does nothing.

Warning

This method is designed to for use in combination with<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_polling"> `run_polling()`</a> or<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook"> `run_webhook()`</a> . Using this method in combination with a custom logic for starting
and stopping the application is not guaranteed to work as expected. Use at your own
risk.

Added in version 20.5.

Changed in version 21.2: Added support for calling within<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.post_init"> `post_init()`</a>.

*async*update_persistence ( ) [[source]](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/v22.0/telegram/ext/_application.py#L1630-L1652) [¶](about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.update_persistence) Updates<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.user_data"> `user_data`</a>,<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.chat_data"> `chat_data`</a>,<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.bot_data"> `bot_data`</a> in<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.persistence"> `persistence`</a> along with<a href="telegram.ext.extbot.html#telegram.ext.ExtBot.callback_data_cache"> `callback_data_cache`</a> and the conversation states of
any persistent<a href="telegram.ext.conversationhandler.html#telegram.ext.ConversationHandler"> `ConversationHandler`</a> registered for this application.

For<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.user_data"> `user_data`</a> and<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.chat_data"> `chat_data`</a> , only those entries are updated which either
were used or have been manually marked via<a href="about:blank#telegram.ext.Application.mark_data_for_update_persistence"> `mark_data_for_update_persistence()`</a> since
the last run of this method.

Tip

This method will be called in regular intervals by the application. There is usually
no need to call it manually.

Note

Any data is deep copied with<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy"> `copy.deepcopy()`</a> before handing it over to the
persistence in order to avoid race conditions, so all persisted data must be copyable.
