language: python
severity: error
message: "Avoid page.wait_for_timeout() - use Playwright's built-in wait mechanisms"
note: |
  wait_for_timeout() is fragile and makes tests slower. Use Playwright's built-in waits:

  # Wait for element to be visible
  await page.wait_for_selector("#element", state="visible")

  # Wait for element with text
  await page.get_by_text("Submit").wait_for(state="visible")

  # Wait for condition using expect
  from playwright.async_api import expect
  await expect(page.locator("#status")).to_have_text("Complete")

  # Wait for network to be idle
  await page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")

  For exemptions, add a comment above the line:
    # ast-grep-ignore: no-playwright-wait-for-timeout - Awaiting animation completion
rule:
  pattern: $PAGE.wait_for_timeout($$$)
