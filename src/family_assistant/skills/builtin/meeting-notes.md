# Meeting Notes Skill

When the user asks to take meeting notes, use this structure:

## Template

- **Date**: {date}
- **Attendees**: {attendees}
- **Agenda**: Key topics discussed
- **Decisions**: What was decided
- **Action Items**: Who does what by when

## Guidelines

1. Keep notes concise but complete
2. Capture decisions explicitly — these are often the most valuable part
3. Each action item should have an owner and a deadline
4. Use the `add_or_update_note` tool to save the final notes
