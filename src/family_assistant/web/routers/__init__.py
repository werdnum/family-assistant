# This file makes the 'routers' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty or can be used to expose specific modules/symbols
# from this package directly, e.g.:
# from .notes import notes_router
# from .history import history_router
# etc.
# For now, keeping it simple and allowing direct imports of the router modules.
